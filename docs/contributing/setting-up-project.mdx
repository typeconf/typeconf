title: Setting up project
---

We use pnpm monorepo for managing the project. Right now this guide is quite simple as we don't have much testing yet.

## Install dependendecies

```
pnpm install
```

## Build all

```
pnpm build
```

## Build just Typeconf

```
pnpm --filter @typeconf/typeconf build
```

## Run tests

```
pnpm --filter @typeconf/typeconf test
```

Test on a single example

```
pnpm --filter @typeconf/typeconf test:simple
```

Test SDK

```
pnpm --filter @typeconf/sdk test
```

If you want to test Typeconf libraries locally with your project you can use these commands:

```
npx link@latest path/to/typeconf/packages/typeconf
npx link@latest path/to/typeconf/packages/sdk
npx link@latest path/to/typeconf/packages/react-sdk
```
