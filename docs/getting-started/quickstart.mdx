## Working with Typeconf

Typeconf helps you manage configurations by keeping them in a separate
directory, which acts as a configuration repository or package for your project.
The configuration directory contains three main components:

- **Schema**: Located at `src/main.tsp`
- **Values file**: Located at `src/values.config.ts`
- **Output JSON file**: Located at `out/<config-name>.json`

## Setting Up the Configuration Directory

To begin using Typeconf, you need to create the configuration directory. Run the following command to generate the necessary boilerplate:

```bash
npx create-typeconf-package
```

After that, you can open a separate terminal window and run this command to
automatically recompile the schema and configuration values whenever you make
changes:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```
Alternatively, you can manually run npm run build whenever you make changes to the configuration files.

## Creating a new config

In Typeconf, configurations are defined using schemas and values separately. The
schema is written using a TypeSpec-based language, which is a TypeScript-like
syntax. Learn more about TypeSpec [here](https://typespec.io/).

### Defining the schema

To modify the schema, locate the `src/main.tsp` file. Here's an example schema:

```typescript
model DebuggingConfig {
  enableLogging: boolean;
  maxRetries: int32;
  timeout: duration;
}

model PetServiceConfig {
  showBreed: boolean;
  petTypes: string[];
  debugging: DebuggingConfig;
}
```

Refer to the TypeSpec
[documentation](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/overview/) for
additional examples and language features.

<Info>
  Remember to run `npm run build` to update the types whenever you modify the schema. 
</Info>

## Setting Config Values

To set the values for your config, edit the `src/values.config.ts` file. Below is
an example of how to configure the values corresponding to the schema above:

```typescript
import { DebuggingConfig, PetServiceConfig } from '~/types/all.js'
let debuggingConfig: DebuggingConfig = {
  enableLogging: true,
  maxRetries: 10,
  timeout: "500ms",
};
let config: PetServiceConfig = {
  showBreed: true,
  petTypes: ["dog", "cat"],
  debugging: debuggingConfig,
};

export default config;
```

## Generating the Output JSON File

After editing the schema and values you should be able to locate the JSON file
in the `out/` directory. Please make sure that you have ran `npm run build`
or that you have `npm run build:watch` running in the background.

## Using the config in your code

<Warning>
  Currently, Typeconf only supports TypeScript, but we plan to add support for other languages in the future. 
</Warning>

To use your configuration in your code, you can install the configuration
package you just created as a dependency. Once installed, you can read the
configuration from any JSON file like this:

```typescript
import { ProductConfig, readConfigFromFile } from "you-config-package";

let conf: ProductConfig = readConfigFromFile("path/to/config.json");
```

Pro tip: If you want to use the configuration package before pushing it to the package registry, you can use this handy tool:

```
npx link@latest <path/to/package>
```
