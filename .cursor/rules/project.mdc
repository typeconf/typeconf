## Project rules

This is a Node.js monorepo project, managed by pnpm.
When you've asked to create a new feature you must put the design decisions in architecture directory.
Before implementation scan the project - find things that you can reuse, understand the component and service structure.
You must make concise changes and avoid updating unrelated files or implementing unrelated features if user didn't ask that explicitly.
Do not run or kill the development server.

You must always confirm that you're following rules by printing mode:typeconf at the start and at the end of your reply.
